          fireworks have on dogs and other pets. While fireworks bring joy and
          celebration to many, they can cause overwhelming stress, fear, and
          even harm to our furry family members. Through education, resources,
          and compassionate advocacy, we aim to help communities celebrate more
          mindfullyâ€”ensuring that every member of the family, paws included, can
          feel safe, calm, and cared for.`,
