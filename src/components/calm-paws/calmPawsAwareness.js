    text: `At Calm Paws, our mission is to raise awareness about the impact
          fireworks have on dogs and other pets. While fireworks bring joy and
          celebration to many, they can cause overwhelming stress, fear, and
          even harm to our furry family members. Through education, resources,
          and compassionate advocacy, we aim to help communities celebrate more
          mindfully—ensuring that every member of the family, paws included, can
          feel safe, calm, and cared for.`,

    text: `If your a dog owner, and when it comes time for the Fourth of July, you
         probably experienced this before. Your dog gets figity, barking, and 
         not having a good time. When dogs hear the loud booms from fireworks, they can 
         start trembling, get confusion, have intense fear, bark excessively, or even run away.
         Unlike humans, dogs don’t understand that fireworks are harmless fun—they just feel
         the noise and chaos. This stress can take a serious toll on their well-being, which is
        why it’s so important to take steps to keep them calm and safe.`,
    moreText: `Make sure your dog is indoors in a quiet, secure space with familiar toys
         or a cozy blanket. Play calming music or white noise to help drown out loud sounds.
         Never leave your dog outside during fireworks, and always ensure they have proper
         ID tags in case they get scared and run. Consider using anxiety wraps, calming 
         treats, or consulting your vet for extra support. With a little preparation, you 
        can help your best friend feel more comfortable during the celebrations.`,
